                            <p>Teleflex Medical Incorporated, a California Corporation with its principal place of business at 3015 Carrington Mill Blvd, Morrisville, North Carolina and Arrow International, Inc., with offices located at 2400 Bernville Road, Reading, Pennsylvania (“Arrow”) (“Teleflex Medical Incorporated” and “Arrow” individually or collectively referred to herein as “Teleflex”). All entities purchasing products from Teleflex are referred to herein as “Buyer” </p>
                            <p>1. Contract. These terms and conditions will apply to all sales of products by Teleflex to Buyer(s). Teleflex’s acceptance of Buyer’s purchase order is expressly limited to the terms and conditions contained herein and any provisions of Buyer’s purchase order which are consistent with the terms and conditions contained herein. Any and all other terms and conditions proposed by Buyer are objected to and rejected by Teleflex. Acceptance of products from Teleflex by Buyer shall be deemed to be an acceptance of these terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time of Buyer’s purchase of products there is in effect a supply, or purchasing, or distributorship agreement between Teleflex and Buyer, any of these terms and conditions which are inconsistent with the provisions of such supply or purchasing agreement shall be ineffective and the terms of the supply or purchasing agreement shall control. </p>
                            <p>2. Purchasing Account Acceptance. Buyer must establish a valid purchasing account with Teleflex prior to purchase order acceptance. If Buyer seeks open credit terms with Teleflex, Buyer must provide all requested information included in Teleflex’s credit application. Teleflex is not responsible, nor offers any remedy to Buyer, for delays in order fulfillment due to Buyer delay in providing incomplete or incorrect information on their submitted credit application. Any change to Buyer purchasing account information, or addition of shipping facility locations, must be submitted in writing prior to Teleflex implementation of this change for subsequent purchase orders placed. </p>
                            <p>3. Payment Terms. Except as otherwise specified to Buyer, the terms of payment for each order of Buyer shall be net thirty (30) days from date of invoice. In the event of nonpayment of an invoice, all collection fees and/or legal fees incurred by Teleflex will be added to the balance owed on the account, as permitted by law. </p>
                            <p>4. Methods of Payment. Teleflex accepts payment via open credit terms (if extended by Teleflex, pursuant to section 8 of these Terms), or payment in advance with a cleared company check or pre-authorized credit card. Teleflex accepts Visa, MasterCard and American Express (excluding Arrow International, Inc., orders) credit cards. </p>
                            <p>5. Purchase Order Acceptance: Teleflex accepts Buyer purchase orders via telephone, fax, email and EDI. EDI connections must be requested in writing and accepted linkage made prior to acceptance of Buyer purchase orders via EDI. Purchase orders are recognized and order placement confirmed by Teleflex within 24 hours of the receipt of Buyer purchase order. </p>
                            <p>6. Purchase Order Cancellations. Teleflex allows Buyer the ability to cancel all or part of their purchase order, excluding any products already in the process of delivery, and products made to order, customized, or repaired for Buyer. All purchase order cancellation requests must be communicated to, and confirmed by Teleflex, prior to being accepted as cancelled. Teleflex offers no Remedy to Buyer for purchase order discrepancies caused by requested order cancellations that do not comply with provisions for order cancellation contained herein. </p>
                            <p>7. Shipping. Products will be shipped as FOB Origin, with risk of loss or damage passing to the Buyer at Teleflex’s shipping point. Teleflex shall not fill orders with requested shipment directly to patients, any residential address, and any temporary or mobile site (hotel, construction site, storage unit, etc). All shipment locations must have Buyer staff on hand to accept and sign for delivered product during normal business hours. All applicable shipping charges are the responsibility of Buyer and will be prepaid by Teleflex and invoiced to Buyer or paid directly by Buyer. </p>
                            <p>7 a. Standard Freight Terms. Teleflex shall ship products via preferred standard ground service carriers, with charges prepaid and invoiced. When Buyer is paying freight, Buyer can select their preferred carrier and method of service. Buyer is responsible for all applicable freight charges, including but not limited to, any special level of service, handling, packaging or freight charges, other than standard ground service, as requested by Buyer. These can include liftgate service, inside delivery, special packaging requirements, special delivery appointments, etc. </p>
                            <p>7 b. Third Party Freight Payment. Buyers participating in a third party freight program can have applicable freight charges billed to their preferred third party freight collect account. Requests to change freight billing for a Buyer to a managed third party freight program must be provided in writing to Teleflex by Buyer, or the Third Party Managed Freight Program acting as the Buyer’s Proxy, no later than five (5) business days prior to expectation of implementation of this service to Buyer. As part of this written request, Buyer, or Buyer’s Proxy, must provide third party freight collect account number(s) to Teleflex, per facility to be added to this program, including any other special instructions needed to ensure compliance to Buyer’s program. Teleflex shall not be liable for any disputed freight charged incorrectly, if the Buyer does not comply with provisions herein.   </p>
                            <p>7 c. Expedited Orders Expedited orders are only processed at the specific request of the Buyer, and when Buyer is specifically requesting at the time of ordering. Buyers request for expedited orders must include the exact level of service needed for the delivery (Next day, Second day, Saturday delivery, early AM, etc.) and a location with valid address that the Carrier can deliver to. Expedited orders are not eligible for free freight of any type, and Buyer is responsible for all freight charges either prepaid and added to the invoice, or through provision of a third party collect account number. Teleflex is not liable for the reliability or outcome of expedite requests, nor will offer Buyer any remedy, due to Carrier error, Carrier delay, Acts of God, and/or any other situations outlined in section 8 of these terms contained herein. </p>

                            <p>8. Force Majeure. Teleflex shall not be responsible nor liable, to Buyer for any failure to perform its obligations to Buyer as a result of any strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, earthquakes, fires, floods, storms or other natural disasters, shortages of materials or supplies or availability of goods or inventory, acts of war, terrorism, crimes, unrest or violence, shipping or other transportation delays or restraints, acts, laws, rules or regulations of any governmental or legal authority, or any other cause or circumstance beyond Teleflex’s reasonable control. </p>
                            <p>9. Taxes. Any sales, use or excise taxes or other charges or levies which Teleflex is required to pay or collect under any applicable law, ordinance, rule or regulation (domestic or foreign), upon or with respect to the sale, shipping, delivery, storage or use of the products purchased by Buyer, shall be for the account of Buyer and Buyer agrees to pay the amount thereof to Teleflex, as invoiced or upon request. </p>
                            <p>10. Product Warranty.

Teleflex makes no warranty whatsoever with respect to reprocessed or repaired products. Teleflex’s sole liability and obligation to Buyer in the event of a breach of the foregoing warranty shall be to replace the defective product or products or, in its discretion, to provide a credit in the amount of the purchase price thereof. </p>
                            <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, TELEFLEX NEITHER MAKES, NOR SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY UNDER, ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR AN INTENDED USE OR PURPOSE.
